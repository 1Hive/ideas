# BEEs & HONEY 🐝🍯

? is a question

! is a problem

BEE = membership token

HONEY = voting/redemption token

BC = bonding curve

### 1Hive Treasury
- can be used for bounties and allocations
- treasury holds ANT that BEEs can use to collectively vote on ANVs (via voting)
- ? how does the treasuty get the ANT/DAI/ETH collateral in the first place? Would there be 1 bonding curve that mints HONEY for ABC_TOKEN, can the same curve accept multiple forms of collateral for HONEY, or would there be several bonding curves that mint HONEY (is that even possible?)?
- ? treasury also holds DAI and HONEY in addition to ANT? Does the treasury hold ETH and any other arbitrary erc-20/721/etc? Would it make more sense to **just hold ANT** since:
    - A) it actually does something and is useful for govenrnance and acquiring ANT increases the influence 1Hive has on Aragon, whereas acquiring DAI does not
    - B) for the most part crypto-currency markets all go up and down together?
- ^^ ANT/HONEY seems simpler. Furthermore, if someone really wants DAI: HONEY => BC = ANT => UniSwap = DAI. DAI doesn't provide any direct benefits since this isn't really a budget with overhead that has quarterly cycels/constraints that need to be met. Also bounties/allocations are in HONEY anyways and the value of HONEY is constantly in flux due to the BC

### BEE = membership
- required to create new votes
- maintaining membership in the org requires being nominated for allocations or earning bounties recently (within the last month or something)
- ? who can earn HONEY from tasks? only BEEs or anyone?

### HONEY BC = a bonding curve that emits HONEY which can be used for voting, redemption against the bonding curve's assets, and/or redemption against treasury's assets
- used for voting. Anyone can vote, but if the voter holds BEE, their HONEY will be weighted by a multiple (say 2x or 3x). this gives BEEs more influence in voting than non-BEEs
- ? why redeem HONEY against the treasury vault vs the bonding curve? They kind of seem like they do the same thing?
- ? if HONEY is used for voting, but anyone can buy it from the curve, then does that mean that anyone can influence how 1Hive votes in the ANV process?
- ! an outside influence with enough capital could purchase enough HONEY to "own" 1Hive. This would result in a rush of BEEs cashing out their HONEY and leaving the project. A few would profit, but ultimately this kind of ruins the community right?
