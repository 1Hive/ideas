# BEEs, HONEY, and POLLEN üêùüçØüå∫

    ? is a question
    ! is a problem

### BEE = membership
- anyone can become a bee by providing
1. funds 
and/or
2. work

by

1. buying pollen
and/or
2. PR/forking/creating any project and working on it
- this saves time wasted on adding/removing bees from the hive, allows honey to solve the problem of allocating funds from the hive community vault, and resolves the previously described issues of "No checks and balances" and "Poor cryptoeconomic alignment"

### HONEY = reputation
- only projects/subprojects/.../milestones/tasks/subtasks/workers can be signaled honey
- bees use POLLEN to determine how incoming hive community funds are allocated to bees, by signaling HONEY (support) for projects/subprojects/.../milestones/tasks/subtasks/contributors:

(incoming funds received by subproject)/(total incoming funds to project) = (HONEY supporting subproject)/(total HONEY supporting subprojects)

- for each organization/project a bee is a direct contributor of (their wallet either earns funds from or pays funds to), they choose how the POLLEN in their wallet is distributed among the subprojects (in the form of signal HONEY, not actually giving away POLLEN)

### POLLEN = signaling/rewards
- anyone can purchase pollen against a bonding curve
- bees can exchange POLLEN against the curve for the underlying asset
- bees can distribute POLLEN to organizations/projects they're a direct contributor of as described above. For example: if a bee is working on a project, but wants help with the UI because they don't like CSS/JS/whatever then they can signal HONEY to that task just like anyone else
  
### Bonding Curve
- This is a way to create an economically self-sustaining hive, by rewarding contributors with:
1. POLLEN whose value is tied to a good/service, in return for underlying asset <--> POLLEN purchase
2. the development of said good/service, in return for funding the hive community vault.
- Anyone can contribute at any time by contributing funds to the hive‚Äôs
1. bonding curve reserve
and
2. community vault

with the funds split in a Œª:1‚àíŒª ratio of reserve:community funding set by the hive (for example, .1:.9 is fitting for an early-stage startup, while .5:.5 would be fitting for an established startup).
- the bonding curve mathematics are described here: https://hackmd.io/@themathematicianisin/BkikbN2kr
- if bees want to fund/support/incentivize projects for the hive, they directly signal POLLEN earned/allocated to the project they want to support
- it is realistic to have a contract automagically handle Vault => Curve => Bounty according to the function

(incoming funds received by subproject)/(total incoming funds to project) = (HONEY supporting subproject)/(total HONEY supporting subprojects)

as part of an optimal resource allocation system based on meritocracy: https://hackmd.io/@themathematicianisin/SyLhKHCWS
