# BEEs, HONEY, and POLLEN üêùüçØüå∫

    ? is a question
    ! is a problem

### BEE = membership
- only bees can earn honey
- anyone can become a bee by contributing
1. funds 
and/or
2. work

by

1. buying pollen
and/or
2. PR/forking/creating any project and working on it
- this saves time wasted on adding/removing bees from the hive, allows honey to solve the problem of allocating funds from the hive community vault, and resolves the issues of No Check and Balances and Poor Cryptoeconomic Alignment

### HONEY = reputation
- only bees can earn honey
- HONEY determines how POLLEN is allocated from the hive community vault to a given bee :

(bee's honey)/(hive's honey) = (bee's pollen)/(hive community vault's pollen)

### POLLEN = signaling/rewards
- anyone can purchase pollen against a bonding curve
- anyone can stake pollen to issues/requests
- if bees earn pollen they can exchange it against the curve for the underlying asset, 
- bees can also allocate POLLEN to whatever tasks they please just like anyone else. For example: if a bee is working on a project, but wants help with the UI because they don't like CSS/JS/whatever then they can stake POLLEN to that task just like anyone else
- bees can also burn POLLEN for HONEY, but HONEY cannot be burned. This is a one-way function. When a bee burns POLLEN for HONEY they are trading immediate financial rewards from the curve for increased influence (voting weight) in the hive. This also increases the value of outstanding POLLEN, creating more rewards for other bees. It's a win/win (I think, research tbd).   

### Bonding Curve
- This is a way to create an economically self-sustaining hive, by rewarding contributors with:
1. POLLEN whose value is tied to a good/service, in return for ETH <=> POLLEN purchase
2. the development of said good/service, in return for funding of projects.
- Anyone can contribute at any time, either as an investor or BEE. Investors contribute funds to the hive‚Äôs
1. bonding curve reserve
and
2. community vault

with the funds split in a p:1‚àíp ratio of reserve:community funding set by the hive (for example, .1:.9 is fitting for an early-stage startup, while .5:.5 would be fitting for an established startup)."
- the bonding curve mathematics are described here: https://hackmd.io/@themathematicianisin/BkikbN2kr
- if bees want to fund/support/incentivize projects for the hive, they directly stake POLLEN earned/allocated to the project they want to support
- it is realistic to have a contract automagically handle Vault => Curve => Bounty according to the function

(bee's honey)/(hive's honey) = (bee's pollen)/(hive community vault's pollen)

as part of a meritocratic system based on projects:

- ? How is honey measured/earned? Perhaps it should be decided by something in between admin/collective, sourcecred.io /automagic. What about conviction voting/auction: https://hackmd.io/@themathematicianisin/Sk-hh3Zgr
