# BEEs, HONEY, and POLLEN üêùüçØüå∫

? is a question
! is a problem

### BEE = membership
- only bees can vote in the hive
- voting includes allowing new bees into the hive, removing bees from the hive, or moving funds from the hive community vault
- ! No Check and Balances: some actions require consent from multiple stakeholder groups. This could look like allowing multiple parties to create proposals and vote, or by having independent votes but then requiring both votes to pass to take an action
- ! Poor Cryptoeconomic Alignment: it is assumed that BEEs would be incentivized to make decisions that create value for the hive, and thus encourage more people to buy POLLEN, and thus creating more work/value for BEEs. This is not a direct incentive model though and is more of a long-term view. Politics, personal goals, and short term outlooks could totally mess that up lol. Maybe better to have a multiple stakeholder system, but where BEE votes are weighted more heavily than those outside the hive.

### HONEY = reputation
- only bees can earn honey
- honey increases the voting power of bees

### POLLEN = signaling/rewards
- anyone can purchase pollen against a bonding curve
- anyone can stake pollen to issues/requests
- if bees earn pollen they can exchange it against the curve for the underlying asset, 
- bees can also allocate POLLEN to whatever tasks they please just like anyone else. For example: if a bee is working on a project, but wants help with the UI because they don't like CSS/JS/whatever then they can stake POLLEN to that task just like anyone else
- bees can also burn POLLEN for HONEY, but HONEY cannot be burned. This is a one-way function. When a bee burns POLLEN for HONEY they are trading immediate financial rewards from the curve for increased influence (voting weight) in the hive. This also increases the value of outstanding POLLEN, creating more rewards for other bees. It's a win/win (I think, research tbd).   

### Bonding Curve
- ETH <=> POLLEN
- at a regular interval (voted on by bees), ETH is moved from the curve into the hive community vault
- if bees want to fund/support/incentivize projects for the hive, they can vote to move ETH from the hive community vault back into the curve to get POLLEN, and then they can stake that POLLEN to the project they want to support
- ? from a technical perspective, is it realistic to have a contract handle Vault => Curve => Bounty? And/or would we want an "admin" (Queen) to manage that process on behalf of the hive until we build a contract/function that does it automagically?
