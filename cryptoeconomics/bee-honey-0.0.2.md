# BEEs & HONEY üêùüçØ V2
- note: this is not a better version than V1, but an alternative

    ? = question
    ! = problem
    BEE = membership token
    HONEY = voting/redemption token
    HIVE = the 1Hive DAO vault

### BEE = membership
- BEE is an NFT that shall not be transferred (either using a non-transferable badge (ERC-1238 type thing) or social contract)
- maintaining membership in the hive (BEE) requires regularly (say every month or so) being nominated for allocations or earning bounties recently
- BEE increases the voting power of bees by a multiple (say 2x or 3x)
- BEEs can nominate other BEEs for a weekly allocation for doing things that benefit the HIVE. 

### HONEY = voting power and influence
- anyone can create a proposal and anyone can use HONEY to vote on proposals. This creates a check on BEE power/influence to ensure that the goals and actions of 1Hive align with the goals of the broader community

### HIVE = 1Hive treasury vault
- receives ANT from the HONEY bonding curve on regular intervals and stores it in a vault
- HONEY holders control the HIVE via voting (bounties, allocations, and ANV participation)
- every week a portion of the HIVE vault is distributed to BEEs via the allocation

### HONEY Bonding Curve
- anyone can exchange ANT for HONEY, or HONEY for ANT
- on a regular basis ANT is moved from the curve to the HIVE

Benefits:
- This model aligns incentives BEE incentives with those of the HIVE, and it also aligns the incentives of the HIVE with ANT holders. This will (hopefully) result in more collaboration and support between each group while also allowing for organic growth and exploration.
- There are checks against the power of BEEs so that their actions align with HONEY holders and the broader ANT ecosystem. This being said, as core members of the HIVE BEEs have more influence than a normal HONEY holder.

Drawbacks:
- An outside influence with sufficient economic resources could buy enough HONEY from the curve to dominate the HIVE. BEEs could then cash out their HONEY to get a lot of ANT, but it would also temporarily ruin the community.
